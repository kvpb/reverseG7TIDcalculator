////	I gotta get my hands dirty. Those five tar√©s from the PKHEX community are obnoxious, more toxic than radioactive waste. If they were helpful at least, I wouldn't say, but they are as useful as square wheels, know nothing, talk about everything. Just five more baltringues. But this is just the usual Reddit-Twitch-Discord clientele, so it doesn't surprise me much. I shouldn't care about them. Let's keep finding out how these games work right now.
////	This algorithm applies to G7TID and G8TID alike, and I bet it will for G9TID too. The question is how do I know all _possible_ values for a G8TID _from a cryptographically secure game_? If they encrypt the seed, ~~or if they just encrypt any part of the process,~~ how can I tell whether I can get any possible value from the above formula? If the maximum value is 65,536 + ( 65,536 * 65,536 ), 4,295,032,832 G8TID theoretically exist. LGPE, SS and LA all rely on nn::crypto::GenerateCryptographicallyRandomBytes. Good luck with that.
*///	Lifelike's Heatwave and Motion are nasty bangers by the way. Sounds like Paolo Del Prete is behind somehow. He seemed to enjoy toying around with Stop like that. Gotta keep spinning that stuff louder on the highway. Heh, I miss my ride. Which motorbike should I get in North America by the way? I haven't thought about it. Let's start with something sturdy and reliable, nothing too pompous. And when I get near a racing track, I'm getting myself a Hayabusa.
